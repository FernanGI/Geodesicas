This is a part of my final degree project, so if you find any bug or problem pleas post it. 
It contains a set of functions to make a basic computations of Christoffel symbols, geodesics, Riemann curvature tensor, Curvature Tensor, Ricci Curvature Tensor and Scalar Curvature. 
To use this set of functions is compulsory to have installed the libraries NumPy and SciPy
